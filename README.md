This is my first Web Dev project. I am so happy and greateful now that I am motivated to learn a new skill which will support me achieving my personal goals. Thanks to the Odin Project who allowed me to learn so much from their knowlodge, shared freely in the internet. In this project I will put in practice what I`ve been learning during the curriculum and learn how to built-up my first blog with recipes from scratch. I will then, in a later stage, also learn how to style the website with using CSS. For now, the project will focus on practicing the HTML structure.

Finally I got! Now let jump to some CSS :)
